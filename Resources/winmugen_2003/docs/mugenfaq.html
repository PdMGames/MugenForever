<h2>What's in the Linux/Windows ports?</h2>

<p>The Linux port features a rewritten graphics engine, player precaching for
transparent load times, multiple joystick support, and of course various
updates and bug fixes. The Windows version doesn't exist yet,
but is likely to have these features; See <a href="#What%20about%20Windows%3f">What about Windows?</a>.

<br>

<h2>Why did M.U.G.E.N move to Linux?</h2>

<p>M.U.G.E.N has moved to Linux for a variety of reasons. The most important
is that the new features that have been added are easily supported
in a modern operating system such as Linux, but not in an operating system
such as DOS.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Meta-Questions">Meta-Questions</a>
<br>

<h2>Where do I get Linux? Give me Linux!</h2>

<p>Linux is available in packages known as distributions. Perhaps the best-known
of these is <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>. Please understand that we
neither offer Linux nor support it ourselves.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Meta-Questions">Meta-Questions</a>
<br>

<h2>What happens to the DOS version?</h2>

<p>The future of the DOS version of M.U.G.E.N is uncertain. It may or may not be
continued in the future. If it is continued, it is certain to be "feature-
deficient" in comparison to the other ports, for the simple reason that the
new functionalities cannot be supported in DOS.

Previous:<a rel=previous href="#What%20about%20DOS%3f">What about DOS?</a>,
Up:<a rel=up href="#Meta-Questions">Meta-Questions</a>
<br>

<h2>What about a Windows version?</h2>

<p>Unlike DOS and Linux, the freely available compilers for Windows are not
sufficient for our purposes. Therefore the availability of a Windows port
is constrained solely by the availability of a compiler for Windows. Compilers
cost money, which we do not have.

<p>If you are interested in a Windows version, please see our
<a href="http://www.elecbyte.com">web page</a> for a brief summary of features
and to see how you can help.

<h2>How much profit have you made to date?</h2>

<p>You can see the current total of all donations on our <a href="http://www.elecbyte.com">web page</a>.

<p>You may have paid money for a complete game made using MUGEN. Typical examples
are DBZ-ME2, Anime Brawl 2, etc. These are pirated games and are neither
authorized nor endorsed by Elecbyte. Needless to say, we do not see any
revenue from these illegal sales.

<p>Authorized distributions of MUGEN do exist on, for instance, magazine demo
CDs. We do not receive revenue from these either.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Meta-Questions">Meta-Questions</a>

<h2>Does this mean you're not supporting my game?</h2>

<p>Complete game distributions, whether downloaded from the net or paid for, are
in violation of the M.U.G.E.N licensing agreement unless explicitly approved
by Elecbyte. We are not currently aware of any authorized third-party MUGEN
distributions. Examples of unauthorized distributions that we have received
support requests for are DBZ-ME2, Anime Brawl 2, the Saint Seiya game, etc. 
Elecbyte has never, and will never, offer support for these games. See the
license agreement in <code>readme.txt</code> for further details. Also: See <a href="#Selling">Selling</a>.

<p>Support requests for old DOS versions of MUGEN (which are not part of game
distributions) will be treated with low priority, like any other support
requests for old versions.

<h2>Is MUGEN Free?</h2>

<p>In the sense of your rights of usage and redistribution, MUGEN is not free. 
The license agreement in readme.txt indicates the restrictions that you
agree to observe by using the software.

<p>In the monetary sense, the stock MUGEN distribution on our website is made
available at no cost to the general public. Authorized redistributors of
MUGEN may charge for their distributions if they so choose. Unauthorized
distribution is a criminal act and falls outside the realm of this
discussion.

<h2>Can I sell a game I make with MUGEN?</h2>

<p>You can't sell MUGEN betas or redistribute them without our permission. 
What you do with the characters and files you make is your decision, but
any distribution of them (whether for profit or not) cannot include the
MUGEN environment itself without our approval. See the license agreement
in readme.txt.

<h2>Will you make a Windows/Macintosh version?</h2>

<p>The Windows version is hung up pending compiler availability; See <a href="#What%20about%20Windows%3f">What about Windows?</a>. 
A Macintosh version will probably never happen.

<h2>Where do I get new characters? Give me characters!</h2>

<p>We cannot send any characters. Other than KFM, who is available from our
<a href="http://www.elecbyte.com">web page</a>, you must look elsewhere.

<br>

<h2>How do I add new characters to the select screen?</h2>

<p>Unzip your character into a new directory under <var>chars/</var>. Note the name of
of the character's <code>.def</code> file.

<p>Now open <code>data/select.def</code>. In the <code>[Characters]</code> group at the
top, add a line that looks like: <code><var>mydir/player.def</var>,
<var>stages/stage.def</var></code>. <var>mydir</var> should be the directory you placed
the character files in, and <var>player.def</var> should be the player's <code>.def</code>
file. <var>stage.def</var> should be the name of the player's stage. If you do
not specify a stage, it will be randomly chosen in the game. The comments
in <code>select.def</code> have additional information.

<p>If your player's <code>.def</code> file name and directory name are the same (for
instance, the directory is <code>kiwi/</code> and the <code>.def</code> file is
<code>kiwi.def</code>), then you can just enter <code>kiwi</code> instead of
<code>kiwi/kiwi.def</code>.

<p>Like many of the other files, <code>select.def</code> is a text file. If you are
using Windows to open the file, choose a text editor such as Notepad
when prompted.

<h2>How do I increase the number of slots in the character select screen?</h2>

<p>Open up <code>data/system.def</code> using a text editor, and look at the
<code>[Select Info]</code> group. Increase the value of <code>rows</code> and
<code>columns</code> to create more slots for additional characters.

<p>You may need to adjust the <code>pos</code> parameter to place the newly-sized
boxes correctly on the screen. A value of 0,0 represents the upper-left
corner, and 319,239 is the lower-right.

<p>For an example of how this works, download the motif "Big" from the
<a href="http://mugen.elecbyte.com/develop.html">developer's section</a>
on our web page.

<h2>This character I downloaded isn't compatible. What do I do?</h2>

<p>The M.U.G.E.N character standard is a work in progress. There is explicitly
no guarantee that characters made for earlier versions will work with later
ones. If a character isn't compatible with a certain version of M.U.G.E.N, it
is the author's responsibility to fix it.

<p>New releases of MUGEN contain compatibility notes (found in <code>updates.txt</code>
 or <code>incompt2.txt</code>) which give instructions on how to bring characters
into compliance with new versions. Elecbyte will not update third-party
characters.

<h2>Fixing characters is too hard! Make a tool for it!</h2>

<p>Elecbyte will never make a character "fixer" or autoupdater. These are the
reasons why:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>It's not our priority. Effort that would be spent maintaining and
debugging an autofixer is better spent maintaining and debugging the engine.

<li>It's not our responsibility. M.U.G.E.N is in a "beta" stage for a very
good reason - namely, it carries no guarantees of usability or
compatibility with previous versions.

<li>It's not possible. No autofixer, even in theory, could correctly update
an arbitrary character without possibly introducing bugs that weren't there
before. Any autofixer can at most be merely one tool among many which are
required to update a character properly. Releasing an "autofixer" tool tends
to mislead the end user into forgetting this basic fact.

Press <kbd>Ctrl-D</kbd> until it goes away or for a more permanent fix, open
<code>data/mugen.cfg</code> and in the <code>[Debug]</code> group, change
<code>Debug = 1</code> to <code>Debug = 0</code>.

<h2>How do I enable my gamepad?</h2>

<p>This can be done from the input configuration screen available under Options. 
Simply choose which player you want to use the joystick, then choose the
appropriate joystick type for that player. The joystick should then be
initialized and you can configure the buttons for it.

<p>If your joystick isn't initialized properly, save your options and then
restart MUGEN. If that still doesn't work, then open up the
<code>data/mugen.cfg</code> and find the <code>[Input]</code> group.  Change the setting
for <code>P1.Joystick.type</code> or <code>P2.Joystick.type</code> to the appropriate
number as indicated in the comments.

<h2>How do I use my Playstation gamepad?</h2>

<p>You need to build a converter to connect your joystick to the computer. 
MUGEN supports the DirectPad Pro converter; schematics are available at
<a href="http://www.ziplabel.com">http://www.ziplabel.com</a>. You will then need to compile the appropriate
joystick driver. The converter connects to the parallel port, so you will
need to disconnect your printer cable if you wish to use the pad.

<p>The DirectPad Pro schematics specify a +5V power supply for the main
controller electronics, and a +9V power supply for the shock motors. 
The standard voltages supplied by the Playstation for these purposes
are, respectively, +3.5V and +7.6V. It is up to you to decide whether
you wish to run at the higher voltages, or build an external power
supply to provide the +3.5V and +7.6V inputs. An external power supply,
though more inconvenient, may be able to supply more power, to
controllers that require it, than the parallel port can. We have
received no reports of damage to Playstation controllers from running at
+5V/+9V, but that does not mean the possibility does not exist.

<p>In any case, neither we nor the DirectPad Pro author can answer
questions about the construction of a PSX converter. Please find a
friend knowledgeable in electronics to help you if you have
difficulties.

<p>When your converter is completed and functioning, set the joystick type
to Auto in the Options screen. You can then configure your joystick buttons.

<p>Note that you can bind the Start button to any physical button on the
PSX joystick, if you choose. The X button functions as a cancel button
in most menus. This is not configurable.

<p>MUGEN does not support analog input. The L3 and R3 switches are supported.

<h2>How do I switch the sounds for the hits and announcers?</h2>

<p>You'll need to build your own <code>fight.snd</code> and <code>common.snd</code> and
place it in a subdirectory under <code>data/</code>. You will need to copy
<code>data/system.def</code> into that subdirectory, and edit it if
necessary. To run with your new <code>system.def</code>, you will need to use
the <code>-r</code> switch at the command line.  For example, if you put the
new files in <code>data/mymotif</code>, then type:

<pre>mugen -r mymotif
</pre>

<p>to use your new motif. See <code>readme.txt</code> for more on custom
motifs.

<h2>Why doesn't MUGEN work with my <var>(insert name)</var> soundcard?</h2>

<p>MUGEN should work with any sound card that works in Linux. However, your

create a symlink to /dev/sound/dsp named /dev/dsp.

<h2>When I try to load a character, MUGEN quits with an error message saying it can't load the character's <code>.sff</code>. What's wrong?</h2>

<p>Most likely, you do not have enough memory to load the character.  Most
characters need at least 16 MB to run, but there are cases where even 32
MB is not enough, especially if the character has an unoptimized sound or
sprite file.

<p>Consult <code>readme.txt</code> for ways to reduce MUGEN's memory consumption.

<h2>I don't have enough memory! Will the next MUGEN support virtual memory?</h2>

<p>MUGEN is in fact using virtual memory. However, you can't
always solve lack of RAM problems by swapping data back and forth from
the hard drive. For instance, swapping character graphics and sounds
from the drive causes a considerable amount of "thrashing", making
MUGEN run too slow for any level of acceptable
gameplay. Further, swapping is automatic, meaning that we have no
control what is actually swapped to disk.

<p>See <code>readme.txt</code> for ways to reduce MUGEN's memory
consumption.

<h2>MUGEN runs slower with some characters! Do I need more memory?</h2>

<p>It is possible the character you are running is unoptimized.  Having
inefficiently-coded states, lots of constantly-checked states, or
overuse of trigger expressions can cause slowdown.  Unless you hear your
hard drive cranking loudly whenever you are playing, you don't have a
RAM problem.

<h2>MUGEN says it can't load <code>data/mugen.cfg</code>. Why not?</h2>

<p>MUGEN expects to find several configuration files within a subdirectory

unpacking. This shouldn't be an issue, though.

<h2>Can you please make an AIR/CNS/CMD/SFF/SND editor?</h2>

<p>Sorry, we do not have plans to make any editors. You are welcome to write your
own frontends and editors if you like. Our formats for .sff and .snd are
published in the
<a href="http://mugen.elecbyte.com/develop.html">developer's section</a> of our
Mugen site.

<h2>Heck, how do I make a character?</h2>

<p>It's not easy, but here's a brief outline to get started. Read up on
the docs for more details.

<ul>
<li>Download KFM from our site. He's a good reference. Also get his work
files, which contain his sprites and a <code>.txt</code> file for piping into
sprmaker. 
<li>Get some sprites ready to use. Even just the standing sprites are enough
to get started. 
<li>Make the <code>.txt</code> file for the <code>.sff</code> of his standing frames. 
<li>Make the <code>.sff</code> using sprmaker. 
<li>Make a <code>.def</code> file (or copy over and edit KFM's)
<li>Make an <code>.air</code> file (or copy over and edit KFM's)
<li>Make a <code>.cns</code> file (or copy over and edit KFM's)
<li>Try it out. Tweak the axes in the <code>.sff</code> until the animation looks
right. Type <code>MUGEN player player</code> to test the character. 
<li>Add walking frames to the <code>.sff</code>, then add frames for animations in
the air. Add jumping, getting hit, etc. 
<li>When you're done with basic movement, it's time to add attacks! That's
when the fun and real work begins (also lots of frustration). 
</ul>

<h2>Making a character is hard! What's the easy way?</h2>

<p>Sorry, there isn't any. MUGEN is very flexible, but with that
flexibility comes work. You can try replacing sprites for KFM and
tweaking with his <code>.air</code> and <code>.cns</code> to get started though.

<h2>Why does my character have a colored box around him?</h2>

<p>You need to set the color of that box to color 0 in his palette. Make
sure your sprites are all 256 colors, with that same palette.

<h2>How do I make an attack move?</h2>

<p>You need several things.

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Sprites for the attack move (in the <code>.sff</code> file). 
<li>An animation action for the attack (in the <code>.air</code> file). 
<li>A move definition specifying the command for the move (in the <code>.cmd</code> file). 
<li>State entry specifying what state to go to when the command is performed
(in the <code>.cmd</code> file). 
<li>States for the move (in the <code>.cns</code> file).
</ol>

<p>See the respective documentation for details.

<br>

<h2>Why doesn't my command work in the <code>.cmd</code>?</h2>

<p>You need to put state entry for a move (call it Move A) before all other
moves that have commands that are subsets of Move A. So if Move A has
command <code>D, F, a</code> then Move A has to be placed before any move that
has command <code>a</code> in the <code>.cmd</code> file.

<h2>My character disappears when he's thrown. What's wrong?</h2>

<p>You do not have all the required sprites as specified in <code>spr.txt</code>. 
Make sure you've added all the required sprites with their specified
numbers, including the ones that have axes in the middle of the body, as
well as at the head. See <code>spr.gif</code> for an illustration of the
required sprites.

<h2>Can I have a separate palette for certain player or projectile sprites?</h2>

<p>Except for the big portrait (9000,1), the answer is no. To see how to
use a different palette for the big portrait, download KFM's work files
and look at the <code>.txt</code> file for his <code>.sff</code>.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Character-specific">Character-specific</a>
<br>

<h2>How do I add a KO sound?</h2>

<p>If you have a sound 11,0 (that's group 11, sound 0) in your character's
<code>.snd</code> file, it will automatically be played as the KO sound.

<br>

<h2>A character I saw did this cool effect. How was it done?</h2>

<p>Take note of which states that character was in, and take a look at it
in his <code>.cns</code> file. The reason for the open file formats is so that you
can share techniques with other developers.
