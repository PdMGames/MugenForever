This directory contains the sprites required to build
data/fightfx.sff, which has the graphics for hit sparks,
dust graphics and other effects that characters commonly
use.

Unzip these files in work/fightfx under your MUGEN directory.
You will need SprMaker, available from our web page.

From your MUGEN directory, you can type
  sprmaker < work\fight\fight.txt

Edit data/fightfx.air to animate the sparks.
