I. Required Sprites
====================================================================

Every character must have what is called "required sprites". These are
sprites that you may not necessarily be using for your animations, but
must always be included in the character's SFF. These sprites are
necessary for your character to appear correctly when thrown.

- Use only these standard frames when making a action in the .air file
  that characters beside yourself will execute. For example, getting
  thrown animation.
- The horizontal component of "Axis" means around the center of the
  character, unless specified otherwise

Standard getting hit
--------------------
- You MUST follow the numbers exactly.
- Axes labelled "where feet would be" should have the axis approximately
  between where both feet would be, if the character was made to stand
  with his center of gravity fixed in the same position as that required
  frame
- Axes labelled "midsection" should have the axis around the waist area
- Axes labelled "head" should have the axis in the middle of the
  character's head
- Some numbers, such as 5000,1 to 5000,9 are for you to add intermediate
  frames if you choose to do so.
- See spr.gif for an example of how the sprites should approximately look
  and where the axes should be placed.
- Sprites labeled with an asterisk (*) are the new required sprites that
  were added since MUGEN version 2000.06.27.
